# Description file for meteorological data.

Data used:
The synoptic analysis was made using graphs and satellite images plotted by the authors or downloaded in the websites of University of São Paulo or other Brazilian official institutions. They are composed by:

Satellite images: the satellite images were obtained at the Satellite Division and Environmental Systems (Divisão de Satélites e Sistemas Ambientais - DSA, in Portuguese) from the CPTEC/INPE website (http://satelite.cptec.inpe.br/acervo). Those images are from the NOAA and NASA satellite Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-16) positioned at 75.2ºW.

Wind direction and speed, air temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure: provided by the São Paulo Environmental Agency (CETESB) automated air quality network [QUALAR, 2020], and displayed by Sergio Ibarra Espinosa (https://ibarraespinosa.github.io/coronavirus/#meteorologia).

Precipitation: As the QUALAR system does not provide precipitation data, this variable was obtained from three official sites available along São Paulo: Água Funda that belongs to IAG/USP (www.estacao.iag.usp.br), and São Paulo-Mirante de Santana and São Paulo-SESC Interlagos that belongs to the INMET (www.inmet.gov.br). In the case of Água Funda, the graphs were available only for the 2019 period and displayed by the Climate Group of Studies (GrEC, in Portuguese) through its monthly report available at www.grec.iag.usp.br.

Surface synoptic charts available at 6 hourly frequency were obtained from CPTEC/INPE at the repository http://img0.cptec.inpe.br/~rgptimg/Produtos-Pagina/Carta-Sinotica/Analise/Superficie/.
